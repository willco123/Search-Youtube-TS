# Search Youtube

## Search for youtube videos and store the titles and associated channel names in a database!

Add a .env file to the root of the project that contains:  
MYSQL_HOST='Your db host'  
MYSQL_USER='Your db username'  
MYSQL_PASSWORD='Your db password'  
PORT='Your port'  
MYAPIKEY='Your Youtube Data Api V3 Key'

The project requires an instance of MYSQL, the user needs to have privileges to create and modify a database.

Head to https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started to grab a Youtube Data API v3 key.

Compile with "tsc" then run "nodemon" in the root of the project to establish the server and call the following endpoints!

## /search

Calling a post request to this endpoint will search youtube for the item sent to it, then store the titles and dates in the database along with the associated channels.
The request should be in JSON format, i.e. {"item" : "Your request here..."}. The key of the JSON file does not matter here.

## /videos

Calling a get request to this endpoint will retrieve all the videos in the database. You can specifiy the ID in the url to search for a specific item.

## /channels

Calling a get request to this endpoint will retrieve all the channels in the database. You can specifiy the ID in the url to search for a specific item.

## Search for specific items

Navigating to the channels or videos endpoint and appending a query in the format ?column=value, will allow you to search for specific items.
Accepted column names are equivalent to those named in the database and are as follows:  
Videos:  
id  
title  
date  
channel_id

Channels:  
id  
channel_name

Examples:  
/videos/1 Will return the the video with an "id" of 1  
/videos/?title=lucid Would return all videos with "lucid" in the title  
/channels/?channel_name=mellow Would return all channels named mellow
